Purpose
-------

Quickly get necessary config files set up when on a new machine. Package
installation is out of scope.

Instructions
------------

Run "make". Inspect the "out/" directory. "make install" will write files into
$HOME.  This will append or replace a file in $HOME depending on whether it's in
the "append" or "replace" directory.

Supported Environments
----------------------

This works on my OS X 10.13.6 "High Sierra" laptop. It probably works in plenty
of other environments.

Bugs and Smells
---------------

- The "make install" stuff is messy and not very Makefile-y.

- I'm doing a weak attempt at Git versioning support because what's in master is
  broken for 2.17.2. I didn't test this with any other versions than 2.17.2 on
  this laptop.
